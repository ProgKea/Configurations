# Configurations
On linux I use X11 instead of wayland. Trust me, it's better. I've
used both for a long time. Wayland introduces more problems than it
solves. Also, when you're using wayland you're probably still running
a X11 server in the background, for compatibility reasons. So running
X11 may actually be less "bloated" as wayland fans would say. I think
X11 is here to stay. Applications like screenkey simply are not
possible on wayland, if I understand correctly. Because wayland has
better "security". Whatever that means.

When people talk about wayland in a positive light, they mostly talk
about hyprland. Its like saying a linux distribution is better than
another because it ships with a DE they prefer. You're not talking
about the underlying system, you're just talking about the software
that uses the system. And if you care about smooth animations and
frequent updates to your system, then switching wayland (hyprland) may
be the right thing to do for you. However, I don't care about
animations, I just care about functionality.
